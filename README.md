# My name is Eliana ðŸ‘‹ 
## she/her/hers
### Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate computer science major, learning about computer organization and programming languages.  
### I like to play video games like Baldurs's Gate 3, Hades, Slay the Princess, Little Goody Two Shoes and the random games I find on Steam and Itch.io
### On a blue moon, I like to read books and write stories. 
### I also make games! Look at my cute little visual novels on itch.io: https://alienshmalien.itch.io/
### I am learning Unreal so some time in the future, prepare for a 3D flappy bird and a farming simulator/Tower Defense in space.
### My ideas are vast and I may not have much time, but I will make as many true as I can.
